# VocalEyes

VocalEyes is an experimental HCI intended to facilitate interpersonal communication for 
the physically impaired.  This project is inspired by Words Plus Inc.'s "EZ Keys" and 
driven by the apparent need for better, low-cost, high-throughput interfaces for
individuals with limited or no motor skills.

### The Vision
We seek to create a POC website which implements the basic functionality necessary to
enable text generation via. a single interaction event (mouse press, keyboard hit, or
other).

Further iterations may include developing a JavaScript framework or site wrapper which
increases the scope of interactions possible for our target audience.

Refer to [this image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17114805/vocaleyesmockupbig.png)
to get an idea of our target interface.  Pretend you see things moving!
